# Scientific Programming - Practical 04

- **Week-4.c**: A program that processes a list of integers, sorts them, and removes duplicates.

## Contents

- `Week-4.c`: Implements the creation, sorting, and deduplication of a list of integers.

## Getting Started

To work with this program, follow the steps below.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- A C compiler (e.g., GCC)
- Git

### Cloning the Repository

Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jai-ganeshan/sciprog_24.git
```

Navigate to the `practical04` directory:

```bash
cd sciprog_24/practical04/practical04
```

## Compilation and Execution

**Compilation:**

```bash
gcc -o Week-4 Week-4.c -lm
```

**Execution:**

```bash
./Week-4
```

**Expected Behavior:**

- The program reads a list of integers from the user.
- It sorts the list in ascending order.
- It removes duplicate elements from the sorted list.
- The program prints the original list, the sorted list with duplicates, and the sorted list without duplicates.
